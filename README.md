## Welcome

The internet is changing. Experts and leaders of major businesses are quickly recognizing the role that generative ai will play in the future of search. Millions of people every day ask artificial intelligence for recommendations, common facts, and how-to knowledge. This trend will continue to grow exponentially in the years to come. However, their are inherent limitations on what AI can and can’t do. It is very good at recalling information, and wording even very complex topics in a way that even a layman can understand. But, it does not possess the specialist knowledge that many online content creators and businesses put into the content they post on their website, nor does it know anything about the things that are going on at that business.

That is where ContentOracle AI Chat comes in. ContentOracle AI Chat bridges the gap between the unique insights your organization offers in your blog content and the power of AI to clearly and concisely get site visitors the information they are looking for. What results is a user experience that doesn’t give vistors a generic answer, but rather an answer uniquely tailored based on your content. Add to this the fact that our AI can recommend relevant posts, products, events, and more based on a goal you set, semantic content anaysis, and a suite of analytic features, and you’ve got a game-changing addition to your user's experience on your website.

## Features

- Fully-customizable AI Search and Chat blocks that can be placed anywhere on your site.
