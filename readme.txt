== Description ==
The internet is changing. Experts and leaders of major businesses are quickly recognizing the role that generative ai will play in the future of search. Millions of people every day ask artificial intelligence for recommendations, common facts, and how-to knowledge. This trend will continue to grow exponentially in the years to come. However, their are inherent limitations on what AI can and can’t do. It is very good at recalling information, and wording even very complex topics in a way that even a layman can understand. But, it does not possess the specialist knowledge that many online content creators and businesses put into the content they post on their website.

That is where ContentOracle AI Search comes in. ContentOracle AI Search bridges the gap between the unique insights your organization offers in your blog content and the power of AI to clearly and concisely explain complex topics. What results is a search experience that doesn’t just tell visitors how any random person would answer a question… but one that actually tells visitors how you would answer. This creates a more streamlined user experience on your site, making it easy for visitors to find what they need. Add to this content and product recommendations based on the query, and a suite of analytic features, and you’ve got a game-changing addition to your website.
